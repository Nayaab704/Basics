      upload-pack tests: avoid a non-zero "grep" exit status
      
      Continue changing a test that 763b47bafa (t5703: stop losing return
      codes of git commands, 2019-11-27) already refactored.
      
      This was originally added as part of a series to add support for
      running under bash's "set -o pipefail", under that mode this test will
      fail because sometimes there's no commits in the "objs" output.
      
      It's easier to fix that than exempt these tests under a hypothetical
      "set -o pipefail" test mode. It looks like we probably won't have
      that, but once we've dug this code up let's refactor it[2] so we don't
      hide a potential pipe failure.

      log, show: add tests for messages containing CRLF
      
      A previous commit adjusted the code in ref-filter.c so that messages
      containing CRLF are now correctly parsed and displayed.
      
      Add tests to also check that `git log` and `git show` correctly handle
      such messages, to prevent futur regressions if these commands are
      refactored to use the ref-filter API.

      index-pack: restore "resolving deltas" progress meter
      
      Commit f08cbf60fe (index-pack: make quantum of work smaller, 2020-09-08)
      refactored the main loop in threaded_second_pass(), but also deleted the
      call to display_progress() at the top of the loop. This means that users
      typically see no progress at all during the delta resolution phase (and
      for large repositories, Git appears to hang).
      
      This looks like an accident that was unrelated to the intended change of
      that commit, since we continue to update nr_resolved_deltas in
      resolve_delta(). Let's restore the call to get that progress back.
      
      We'll also add a test that confirms we generate the expected progress.
      This isn't perfect, as it wouldn't catch a bug where progress was
      delayed to the end. That was probably possible to trigger when receiving
      a thin pack, because we'd eventually call display_progress() from
      fix_unresolved_deltas(), but only once after doing all the work.
      However, since our test case generates a complete pack, it reliably
      demonstrates this particular bug and its fix. And we can't do better
      without making the test racy.
